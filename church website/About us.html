<P><i>This church was established on June 25 1998<br>
     By Rev. Elisha F. Sesay and later reached to Rev. Tulay Johnson in the Congo Town belt in the year 1998. <br>
    They started in a small mat round place when it was just a prayer band in 2005. The prayer band was run by Rev. <br>
     Elisha and Rev. Tulay who fought it very hard by the Grace of God through encouraging other people to join the prayer band. <br>
     Later in 2006, They started to put foundations down 2010, for the building of the church with the little help they both gathered offerings <br>
      finally, they build the church up to roof level. The church building was complected in 2016, When they started from the beginning with the building<br>
       of the church people had all kinds of things to say and even provoke them that they didnâ€™t know what they were up to but yet still, they all hold to one <br>
       ground and kept their faith to complete what they have started. With the help of God, The church was completed with enough <br>
      spaces within the church yard. Remember this always, in everything that you do always put God first and have faith then wait to see the work of the Almighty God.
